# 🛍️ Retail Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

This project uses retail sales data to perform **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis and identify customer segments like "Champions", "Loyal Customers", and "At Risk" groups to support data-driven marketing.

## 📁 Dataset Used
Final output is saved in:
- [`final_rfm_segments.csv`](./final_rfm_segments.csv): Cleaned customer-level dataset with RFM scores and segment tags.

## 🔍 RFM Explained
| Metric    | Meaning                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| Recency   | Days since last purchase                 |
| Frequency | Number of purchases                      |
| Monetary  | Total amount spent                       |

Each metric is scored (1–5), and combined into an overall `RFM Score`, used to assign customer segments.

## 🔢 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib for Visualization
